                       draft-matsuhira-m46e-pr-17

Abstract

   This document specifies M46E Prefix Resolution (M46E-PR)
   specification.  M46E-PR connect IPv4 stub networks between IPv6
   backbone network.  And also, M46E-PR can stack many IPv4 networks,
   i.e. the nwtworks using same IPv4 private addresses without
   interdependence.

1.  Introduction

   This document provide M46E Prefix Resolution (M46E-PR) specification.

   The basic strategy for IPv6 deployment is dual stack.  However,
   because of exhaustion of IPv4 address, there will be no IPv4
   addresses for configuring dual stack in near future.  That means
   there will be IPv6 only networks automatically.

   However, there are many IPv4 only networks still exist and those
   seems continuous use in near future.  That means methods continuous
   use of IPv4 network over IPv6 only network will be required.

   M46E-PR also provide such methots.


2.  Basic Network Configuration

   Figure 1 shows network configuration with M46E-PR.  The network
   consists of three parts, backbone network, stub network, and M46E-PR.

   Backbone network can be operated with IPv6 only.  Stub network has
   three cases, IPv4 only, Dual Stack (both IPv4 and IPv6), and IPv6
   only.

   M46E-FP connects backbone network and stub network in case IPv4 still
   works in that stub network.  If stub network is IPv6 only, M46E-PR is
   not needed.

3.  Basic Function of M46E-PR

   M46E-PR has mainly two function.  One is IPv4 over IPv6 Encapsulation
   / Decapsulation, and another is generate a table where IPv4 stub
   network belong to IPv6 network.

3.1.  IPv4 over IPv6 Encapsulation / Decapsulation

   M46E-PR excapsulates IPv4 packet to IPv6 from stub network to
   backbone network, and decapsulates IPv6 packet to IPv4 from backbone
   network to stub network.  Figure 2 shows packet format on both
   backbone network and stub network.

3.2.  M46A architecture


   M46A is a IPv6 address used in outer IPv6 header which encapsulate
   IPv4 packet by M46E-PR.  M46A is described in
   [I-D.draft-matsuhira-m46a].Figure 3 shows M46A address architecture.

    +--------------------------+------------------------+--------------+

                               Figure 3

   M46E address consists of three parts as follows.


   M46A prefix
      M46A prefix.  This value is not a fixed value, and resolved packet
      by packet

   IPv4 network plane ID
      IPv4 network plane ID is an identifier of IPv4 network stack over
      IPv6 backbone network.

   IPv4 address
      IPv4 address in inner IPv4 packet.

3.3.  Resolving M46A

   M46E-PR resolve M46A using M46E Prefix Resolution Table (M46E-PR
   Table).  M46E-PR generate M46E-PR address resolving M46A prefix from
   IPv4 network plane ID and IPv4 address.  FigureFigure 4 show this
   processing.

Internet-Draft                   M46E-PR                    October 2024


   Resolving destination address, M46E-PR use pre-configured IPv4
   network plane ID valude, and destination address of IPv4 packets, and
   serch the M46E-PR table.  M46E-PR table return the M46E-PR address
   prefix value correspoiding IPv4 network plane ID and IPv4 destination
   address.  Then M46E-PR generate whole M46E-PR address.

   Resolving source address, M46E-PR already know IPv4 network plane ID
   value and IPv6 address prefix as M46E-PR prefix.  So, searching the
   M46E-PR table does not require for resolving source address.


4.  Mode of M46E-PR

   M46E-PR has two working mode, one is router mode, another is host
   mode.

4.1.  Router mode

   In router mode, M46E-PR act as a IPv6 router.  M46E-PR occupy IPv6
   subnet, and M46E-PR advertise route for M46E-PR.

4.2.  Host mode

   In host mode, M46E-PR act as a IPv6 host.  M46E-PR share IPv4 subnet,
   that mean, M46E-PR and IPv6 hosts exists on same IPv6 subnet.  M46E-
   PR do proxy NDP function for IPv4 host.

5.  Sample configuration

   Figure Figure 6shows sample confiuration of M46E-PR.  In this
   example, there are three IPv4 stub network with the same IPv4 network
   plane.
