Abstract

   This document specifies Multiple IPv4 - IPv6 address mapping
   encapsulation - fixed prefix (M46E-FP) specification.  M46E-FP makes
   backbone network to IPv6 only.  And also, M46E-FP can stack many IPv4
   networks, i.e. the networks using same IPv4 (private) addresses,
   without interdependence.

1.  Introduction

   This document provides Multiple IPv4 - IPv6 address maping
   encapsulation - fixed prefix (M46E-FP) specification.

   The basic strategy for IPv6 deployment is dual stack.  Viewing this
   strategy from operational side, operation cost of dual stack is
   higher than single stack operation.  Viewing from future, IPv6 only
   operation is more reasonable rather than IPv4 only operation.
   Therefore IPv6 only operation is desired.

   M46E-FP makes backbone network to IPv6 only and privide IPv4
   connectivities.  And also, M46E-FP can stack many IPv4 networks, i.e.
   the networks using same IPv4 (private) address, without
   interdependence.

2.  Architecture of M46E-FP


   IP address contain two information, one is locator information, and
   another is identifier information.  This is basic architecture of
   internet protocol, and also the Internet, and no difference between
   IPv4 and IPv6.


   Locater is a information related "Where", and indentifier is a
   information related "Who".  That mean, IP address's semantics is
   "Where's Who" meaning.  Host is identified whole IP address
   information, that is "Where's Who", however route to the host is
   identified just locator information in IP address, that is "Where".
   See Figure 1.


        |<------ IP address ------------------>|
        |<----- Locator ----->|<--Identifier-->|
               (Where )             (Who)
        +---------------------+----------------+
        |                     |                |
        +---------------------+----------------+

                                  Figure 1

   In IPv4 address space, some host has IPv4 address, which consist n
   bits length identifier and 32 - n bits locator.  In Where's Who
   representation, 32 - n bits "Where" and n bits "Who".


   Keeping such "Where's Who" relation, IPv4 address can be represent as
   IPv6 address by expanding "Where" information from 32 - n bits to 128
   - n bits.  Expanding " Where" information, IPv4 address can be mapped
   to IPv6 address.  Figure 2 shows such expanding.

                                  Figure 2

   IPv4 address space contain private address, that is non globally
   unique IP address.  If some identifier which distinguish private
   address can introduce in IPv6 address space, we can treate IPv4
   private address as different address in IPv6 address space.  This
   document define such identifier as "IPv4 network plane ID".  "IPv6
   network plane ID" can provide VPN (Virtual Private Network) like
   service.


   That is M46A.  In M46E-FP address, "Where" information's bit length
   is 128 -n bits, and "Who" information's bit length is n bits.
   Figure 3 shows summary of IPv4 address and M46E-FP address relation.

3.  Basic Network Configuration

   Figure 4 shows network configuration with M46E-FP.  The network
   consists of three parts.  Backbone network, stub network, and M46E-
   FP.

   Backbone network is operated with IPv6 only.  Stub network has three
   cases.  IPv4 only, Dual Stack (both IPv4 and IPv6), and IPv6 only.

   M46E-FP connects backbone network and stub network in case IPv4 still
   works in that stub network.  If stub network is IPv6 only, M46E-FP is
   not needed.

   Campus network, corporate network, ISP and datacenter network are the
   example for such network.

4.  Basic Function of M46E-FP

   M46E-FP has mainly two function.  One is IPv4 over IPv6 Encapsulation
   / Decapsulation, and another is advertise route for stub network.


4.1.  IPv4 over IPv6 Encapsulation / Decapsulation


   M46E-FP encapsulates IPv4 packet to IPv6 from stub network to
   backbone network, and decapsulates IPv6 packet to IPv4 from backbone
   network to stub network.  Figure 5 shows such movement.

                                  Figure 5

   M46E-FP MUST support tunnel MTU discovery [RFC1853].  When
   encapsulated IPv6 Packet size exceed path MTU and inner IPv4 packet
   have the Don't Fragment bit is set, M46E-FP MUST return ICMP
   Destination unreachable message with Type3 Code4, fragmentation
   needed and DS set [RFC0792].


   In case IPv6, M46E-FP just relays IPv6 packet.

                                  Figure 6

   By IPv4 over IPv6 function, M46E-FP make backbone network to IPv6
   only.


4.2.  M46A architecture

   M46A is a IPv6 address used in outer IPv6 header which encapsulate
   IPv4 packet by M46E-FP.  M46A is described in M46A
   [I-D.draft-matsuhira-m46a].

   Figure 7 shows M46A address architecture

                                  Figure 7

   M46A consists of three parts as follows.

Internet-Draft                   M46E-FP                    October 2024


   M46A prefix
      M46A prefix.  This value is fixed value and preconfigured to all
      M46E-FP in the networks.

   IPv4 network plane ID
      IPv4 network plane ID is an identifier of IPv4 network stack over
      IPv6 backbone network.  This value is preconfigured depend on the
      M46E-FP belong which IPv4 network plane.  For more detail see
      Section 5.

   IPv4 address
      IPv4 address in inner IPv4 packet.

   M46A is resolved copying IPv4 address in inner IPv4 packet, and
   preconfigured values, M46A prefix and IPv4 network plane ID.

4.3.  Route Advertisement


   M46E-FP converts stub network's IPv4 route to M46E-FP IPv6 route and
   advertises to backbone network.  And reverse direction, M46E-FP
   converts M46E-FP IPv6 route to IPv4 route, that advertises other IPv4
   stub networks.

   The IPv4 route for stub network is map to M46E-FP IPv6 route one to
   one, so number of route of IPv4 is same as number of route of M46E-FP
   IPv6 route.  Total number of route is same as when backbone network
   operate dual stack, without M46E-FP.


   In stub network, usual dynamic routing protocol for IPv4 and IPv6 can
   be used such as RIPv2 [RFC2453], RIPng [RFC2080], OSPFv2 [RFC2328],
   OSPFv3 [RFC2740] and IS-IS [RFC1195][RFC5308].  Similarly, in
   backbone network, usual dynamic routing protocol for IPv6 can be used
   such as RIPng [RFC2080], OSPFv3 [RFC2740] and IS-IS [RFC5308] .


   If want using default route, default M46E-FP advertise the route
   [M46E-FP address prefix/( 96 - m )] as default route.  If want using
   different default route by IPv4 network plane ID, default M46E-FP in
   IPv4 network plane #1 advertise the route [ M46E-FP address prefix +
   IPv4 network plane ID #1 / 96] as default route.  Figure 10 in
   Section 7 show the example using default route.

5.  Stacking IPv4 Networks


   M46E-FP can provide VPN like service to stub networks by using
   different IPv4 network plane ID value.

   If backbone network operator provide IPv4 privates network service to
   Organization A, backbone network operator sets IPv4 network plane ID
   value =1 to the M46E-FP which connects stub network of organization
   A.  If there are five stub network of organization A, backbone
   network operator sets same IPv4 network plane ID = 1, to five M46E-
   FPs which connect stub network of organization A.  If there are one
   hundred stub network of organization B, backbone network operator
   sets same IPv4 network plane ID = 2, to one hundred M46E-FPs which
   connect stub network of organization B.  If a new stub network in
   organization B join, backbone network operator configures same IPv4
   network plane ID = 2, to the new stub network only, which connect
   stub network of organization B, and no configuration is needed to one
   hundred M46E-FPs which are already connected.

   Such configuration, that means same stub network group to same IPv4
   network plane ID value, is simple and easy to understand, so, it is
   expected that possibility of misconfiguration is very low.  And also,
   number of configuration is minimum, that mean, number of
   configuration is same as number of stub networks, and add new stub
   network, configure to new one only.

   Describe above, M46E-FP can provide VPN like service, for example,
   Intranet or extranet.  And, after IPv4 global address running out,
   some service provider may want to reuse IPv4 private address.  M46E-
   FP can provide such IPv4 private address networks over single IPv6
   backbone network.  By M46E-FP, some service providers may reuse IPv4
   private address.

6.  Redundancy of M46E-FP


   M46E-FP brings no limit for redundancy.  Figure 8 shows such example
   in case two connection between backbone network and stub network.
   Number of link between backbone network and stub network is not
   limited, and different type of link can be used, for example, for
   wire and wireless.

   Configuration of M46E-FPs, which connect same stub network, is same.
   That mean same M46E-FP prefix and same IPv4 network plane ID value.

7.  Example of M46E-FP Operation


7.1.  Basic M46E-FP Operation


   Figure 9 shows M46E-FP operation which does not use IPv4 network
   plane ID.  In this example, two stub network is connected to backbone
   network via M46E-FP.  One stub network is 10.1.1.0/24 sub network,
   and the other is 10.1.2.0/24 sub network.

   When M46E-FP receives IPv4 route advertisement, then M46E-FP convert
   this IPv4 route to IPv6 route by address resolution to M46E-FP
   address, and advertise this IPv6 route to backbone network.  When
   M46E-FP receives IPv6 route advertisements, then M46E-FP converts
   this IPv6 route to IPv4 route if this IPv6 route is match M46E-FP
   address ( same prefix with M46E-FP), and advertise this IPv4 route to
   stub network.

   In this example.  IPv4 route, 10.1.1.0/24 is converted to IPv6 route,
   <M46E-FPprefix>:10.1.1.0/120,and IPv4 route, 10.1.2.0/24 is converted
   to IPv6 route, <M46E-FPprefix>:10.1.2.0/120 at M46E-FP from stub
   network to backbone network.  And, from backbone network to stub
   network, IPv6 route, <M46E-FPprefix>:10.1.1.0/120 is converted to
   IPv4 route, 10.1.1.0/24, and IPv6 route, <M46E-FPprefix>:10.1.2.0/120
   is converted to IPv4 route, 10.1.2.0/24.

                                  Figure 9


   Figure 10 shows the example using default route.  Default route is
   useful in case most packets are routed same path.  Typically, access
   network is one of the example.  Although using default route,
   communication between stub networks can be done.  Communication
   between host 10.1.1.1 and host 10.1.2.1 can be done inside in access
   network, and does not pass over default M46E-FP.

7.2.  M46E-FP Operation with plane ID


   Figure 11 shows M46E-FP operation which uses IPv4 network plane ID.
   In this example, there are two planes, and two stub network in each
   plane is connected to backbone network via M46E-FP.  In each plane,
   one stub network is 10.1.1.0/24 sub network, and the other is
   10.1.2.0/24 sub network, that means same IPv4 address is used in
   different plane.

   When M46E-FP receives IPv4 route advertisements, then M46E-FP
   converts this IPv4 route to IPv6 route by address resolution to M46E-
   FP address, and advertise this IPv6 route to backbone network.  When
   M46E-FP receives IPv6 route advertisements, then M46E-FP converts
   this IPv6 route to IPv4 route if this IPv6 route is match M46E-FP
   address ( same prefix with M46E-FP), and advertises this IPv4 route
   to stub network.

   In this example in plane #1.  IPv4 route, 10.1.1.0/24 is converted to
   IPv6 route, <M46E-FPprefix><#1>:10.1.1.0/120,and IPv4 route,
   10.1.2.0/24 is converted to IPv6 route, <M46E-
   FPprefix><#1>:10.1.2.0/120 at M46E-FP from stub network to backbone
   network.  And, from backbone network to stub network, IPv6 route,
   <M46E-FPprefix><#1>:10.1.1.0/120 is converted to IPv4 route,
   10.1.1.0/24, and IPv6 route, <M46E-FPprefix><#1>:10.1.2.0/120 is
   converted to IPv4 route, 10.1.2.0/24.

   And also, In this example in plane #2.  IPv4 route, 10.1.1.0/24 is
   converted to IPv6 route, <M46E-FPprefix><#2>:10.1.1.0/120,and IPv4
   route, 10.1.2.0/24 is converted to IPv6 route, <M46E-
   FPprefix><#2>:10.1.2.0/120 at M46E-FP from stub network to backbone
   network.  And, from backbone network to stub network, IPv6 route,
   <M46E-FPprefix><#2>:10.1.1.0/120 is converted to IPv4 route,
   10.1.1.0/24, and IPv6 route, <M46E-FPprefix><#2>:10.1.2.0/120 is
   converted to IPv4 route, 10.1.2.0/24.

   In IPv6 space, address <M46E-FPprefix><#1>:10.1.1.1 and address
   <M46E-FPprefix><#2>:10.1.1.1 are different address, route <M46E-
   FPprefix><#1>:10.1.1.0/120 and route <M46E-FPprefix><#2>:10.1.1.0/120
   are different route, although in IPv4 space, address 10.1.1.1 in
   plane #1 and 10.1.1.1 in plane#2 are same address, route 10.1.1.0/24
   in plane#1 and route 10.1.1.0/24 in plane#2 are same route.

Internet-Draft                   M46E-FP                    October 2024


   *  Can allocate IPv4 address to stub networks, which used in backbone
      network before installing M46E-FP

   *  Less configuration

   *  No need for special protocol

   *  No dependent Layer 2 network

   *  Can Stack IPv4 Private networks

   *  Easy stop IPv4 operation in stub network for future ( just remove
      M46E-FP)

   *  Provide redundancy


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.

10.  Security Considerations

   M46E-FP use automatic Encapsulation / Decapsulation technologies.
   Security consideration related tunneling technologies are discussed
   in RFC2893[RFC2893], RFC2267[RFC2267], etc.
