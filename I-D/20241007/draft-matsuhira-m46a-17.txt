            Multiple IPv4 - IPv6 mapped IPv6 address (M46A)
                        draft-matsuhira-m46a-17

Abstract

   This document specifies Multiple IPv4 - IPv6 mapped IPv6
   address(M46A) spefification.  M46A is an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address
   with a plane ID.  Unique allocation of plane id value enables IPv4
   private address unique in IPv6 address space.  This address may use
   IPv4 over IPv6 encapsulation and IPv4 - IPv6 translation.

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies Multiple IPv4 - IPv6 mapped IPv6
   address(M46A) spefification.  M46A is an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address
   with a plane ID.  Unique allocation of plane ID value enables IPv4
   private address unique in IPv6 address space.

   This address may use IPv4 over IPv6 encapsulation such as Multiple
   IPv4 - IPv6 mapping encapsulation - fixed prefix (M46E-FP) M46E-FP
   [I-D.draft-matsuhira-m46e-fp], Multiple IPv4 - IPv6 mapping
   encapsulation - prefix resolution (M46E-PR)M46E-PR
   [I-D.draft-matsuhira-m46e-pr], Multiple IPv4 - IPv6 mapping
   encapsulation - prefix translator (M46E-PT)M46E-PT
   [I-D.draft-matsuhira-m46e-pt] and IPv4 - IPv6 translation such as
   Multiple IPv4 - IPv6 mapping translator (M46T)M46T
   [I-D.draft-matsuhira-m46t].

2.  M46A architecture


   Figure 1 shows M46A architecture.

    |      96 - m bits      |          m bits          |     32 bits  |
    +-----------------------+--------------------------+--------------+
    |      M46A prefix      |  IPv4 network plane ID   | IPv4 address |
    +-----------------------+--------------------------+--------------+

   M46A consists of three parts as follows.

   M46A prefix
      M46A prefix.  This value is fixed value with M46E-FP, and non
      fixed value with M46E-PR.

   IPv4 network plane ID
      IPv4 network plane ID is the network identification of the IPv4
      network plane.

   IPv4 address
      IPv4 address
