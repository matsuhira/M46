Abstract

   This document specifies Multiple IPv4 - IPv6 mapping encapsulation -
   Prefix Translator (M46E-PT) specification.  M46E-PT expand IPv4
   network plane by connecting M46E-FP domain and M46E-PR domain.  M46E-
   PT translate prefix part of M46E-FP address and M46E-PR address both
   are IPv6 address.  M46E-PT does not translate IPv4 packet which is
   encapsulated, so transparency of IPv4 packet is not broken.

1.  Introduction

   This document provide M46E Prefix Translator (M46E-PT) specification.

   The basic strategy for IPv6 deployment is dual stack.  However,
   because of exhaustion of IPv4 address, there will be no IPv4
   addresses for configuring dual stack in near future.  That means
   there will be IPv6 only networks automatically.

   However, there are many IPv4 only networks still exist and those
   seems continuous use in near future.  That means methods continuous
   use of IPv4 network over IPv6 only network will be required.

   M46E-FP [I-D.draft-matsuhira-m46e-fp] provide such methods.  In
   addition, M46E-PR [I-D.draft-matsuhira-m46e-pr] also provide such
   methots.  M46E-FP is backbone network based approach, on the other
   hand, M46E-PR is stub network based approach.

   M46E-PT expand IPv4 network plane by connecting M46E-FP domain and
   M46E-PR domain.  M46E-PT translate prefix part of M46E-FP address and
   M46E-PR address both are IPv6 address.  M46E-PT does not translate
   IPv4 packet which is encapsulated, so transparency of IPv4 packet is
   not broken.


2.  Basic Network Configuration

   Figure 1 shows network configuration with M46E-PT.  At large view,
   the network consists three parts, M46E-FP domain, M46E-PR domain, and
   M46E-PT.  M46E-PT connect M46E-FP domain and M46E-PR domain.

                                  Figure 1


   M46E-FP domain consists three parts, backbone network, stub network
   and M46E-FP.  Backbone network can be operated with IPv6 only.  Stub
   network has three cases, IPv4 only, Dual Stack (both IPv4 and IPv6),
   and IPv6 only.M46E-FP connects backbone network and stub network in
   case IPv4 still works in that stub network.  If stub network is IPv6
   only, M46E-FP is not needed.  M46E-FP is a backbone network based
   approach, that mean M46E-FP advertise special route for M46E-FP.

   And also, M46E-PR domain consists three parts, backbone network, stub
   network and M46E-FP.  Backbone network can be operated with IPv6
   only.  Stub network has three cases, IPv4 only, Dual Stack (both IPv4
   and IPv6), and IPv6 only.M46E-FP connects backbone network and stub
   network in case IPv4 still works in that stub network.  If stub
   network is IPv6 only, M46E-PR is not needed.  M46E-PR is a stub
   network based approach.

3.  Basic function of M46E-PT

   This section describe basic function of M46E-PT.

3.1.  Translation processing

   M46E-PT translate between M46E-FP packet and M46E-PT packet.  M46E-FP
   packet and M46E-PT packet are almost the same, however IPv6 address
   are different.

   Fig shows packet format of M46E-FP domain and M46E-PT domain.

3.2.  M46A architecture


   M46E-FP and M46E-PR use M46A [I-D.draft-matsuhira-m46a].

3.3.  Resolving translate prefix


   M46E-PT translate from M46E-FP prefix to M46E-PR prefix, or from
   M46E-PR prefix to M46E-FP prefix using M46E-FP Prefix Translation
   (M46E-PT) table. fig Figure 4shows address resolution manner and fig

3.4.  Destination address resolution

   For address resolution for destination address, M46E-PT use M46E-PT
   table.



3.5.  Source address resolution

   For address resolution for source address, M46E-PT use interface
   information, not M46E-PT table.  From M46E-FP domain to M46E-PR
   domain, M46E-PT use IPv6 address prefix of the interface which belong
   M46E-PR domain.  From



4.  Sample Configuration



   Figure Figure 6shows sample confiuration of M46E-PT.  In this
   example, there are four IPv4 stub network with the same IPv4 network
   plane, and two of four are in M46E-FP domain and other two of four
   are in M46E-PR domain.

   In this example, M46E-FP prefix is 2001:0db8:0:46::/64.
